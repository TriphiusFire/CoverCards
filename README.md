# CoverCards

The goal of CoverCards is to create useful study pages without the need for note taking, printing, highlighting, etc

On the left of the screen there are 2 buttons, "Cover" and "Remove Button". 

When you highlight some text and click "Cover" the text color and background turn black, but when you hover over the covered text it reveals. 

It's basically on screen flash cards

If you mess up and want to delete a cover, just click the black cover and the text is restored.

When you click "Remove Button" the cover and remove buttons go away.

You can save the webpage as study material so when you open this from file the page retains all the "flash cards".  
If you click on a cover card from a saved webpage, the cover card will not go away, so the study page is preserved.

I recommend using ctrl+shift+i to see page elements and manually delete all the elements (ie: adds, extra info you don't need, etc) before saving for a more pleasurable studying experience.

I'll try to upload some sample study-pages soon.
